## Objective

- Use SASS variables for colors and fonts.
- Use a mixin for a hover effect on the navigation menu items.

### Student 2: Main Content
- Create a `_main.scss` partial file.
- Design the main content of the webpage. This could be a product description, blog content, portfolio items, etc.
- Use SASS nesting to style any lists, sections, or other nested elements in the main content.

### Student 3: Sidebar
- Create a `_sidebar.scss` partial file.
- Design a sidebar for the webpage. This could include additional navigation, featured items, related posts, etc.
- Use SASS inheritance to create consistent styles for any widgets in the sidebar.

### Student 4: Footer
- Create a `_footer.scss` partial file.
- Design the footer of the webpage. This could include contact information, social media links, a site map, etc.
- Use a SASS function to create a color scheme for the footer.

### Student 5: Interactive Elements
- Create a `_interactive.scss` partial file.
- Design and implement interactive elements on the webpage. This could include buttons, forms, dropdowns, modals, etc.
- Use SASS mixins to create hover effects, transitions, and animations for these interactive elements.

## Submission
Each student should submit their individual `.scss` partial file. Additionally, the group should submit a final compiled `.css` file and the `.html` file of their webpage.

## Evaluation
The Exercise will be evaluated based on the correct use of SASS features, the design of the webpage, and the functionality of the interactive elements.

Good luck!
